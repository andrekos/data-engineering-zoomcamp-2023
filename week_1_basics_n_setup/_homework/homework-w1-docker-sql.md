# Week 1 Homework

In this homework we'll prepare the environment  and practice with Docker and SQL


## Question 1. Knowing docker tags üèÅ

Run the command to get information on Docker `docker --help`. Now run the command to get help on the "docker build" command. Which tag has the following text? - *Write the image ID to the file* 

- `--iidfile string`

```docker
> docker --help build
```


```
Usage:  docker build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -

Build an image from a Dockerfile

Options:
      --add-host list           Add a custom host-to-IP mapping (host:ip)
      --build-arg list          Set build-time variables
      --cache-from strings      Images to consider as cache sources
      --disable-content-trust   Skip image verification (default true)
  -f, --file string             Name of the Dockerfile (Default is
                                'PATH/Dockerfile')
      --iidfile string          Write the image ID to the file
```

## Question 2. Understanding docker first run üèÅ

Run docker with the python:3.9 image in an interactive mode and the entry point of bash. Now check the python modules that are installed ( use pip list).  How many python packages/modules are installed?

- 3

First, run this line in cmd to get a shell prompt 
```
docker run -it --rm --entrypoint /bin/bash python:3.9
```

then  type ``pip list` at the shell prompt to list the globally installed packages
```bash
root@4e4e38f47005:/# pip list
Package    Version
---------- -------
pip        22.3.1
setuptools 58.1.0
wheel      0.38.4
root@4e4e38f47005:/#
```


# Prepare Postgres

Run Postgres and load data as shown in the videos. We'll use the green taxi trips from January 2019: `wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/green/green_tripdata_2019-01.csv.gz`

You will also need the dataset with zones: `wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/misc/taxi+_zone_lookup.csv` Download this data and put it into Postgres (with jupyter notebooks or with a pipeline)

## Question 3. Count records üèÅ

How many taxi trips were totally made on January 15? Tip: started and finished on 2019-01-15. 

- 20530

```sql
select count(*) from green_taxi_trips where date(lpep_pickup_datetime) = '2019-01-15' and  date(lpep_dropoff_datetime) = '2019-01-15'
```

```
+-------+
| count |
|-------|
| 20530 |
+-------+
SELECT 1
Time: 0.080s
```


## Question 4. Largest trip for each day üèÅ

Which was the day with the largest trip distance. Use the pick up time for your calculations.

- 2019-01-15

```sql
SELECT max(trip_distance) as max_distance, date(lpep_pickup_datetime) as date FROM green_taxi_trips GROUP BY date order by max_distance desc limit 4
```

```
+--------------+------------+
| max_distance | date       |
|--------------+------------|
| 117.99       | 2019-01-15 |
| 80.96        | 2019-01-18 |
| 64.27        | 2019-01-28 |
| 64.2         | 2019-01-10 |
+--------------+------------+
SELECT 4
Time: 0.186s
```


## Question 5. The number of passengers üèÅ

In 2019-01-01 how many trips had 2 and 3 passengers?
 
 - 2: 1282 ; 3: 254

```sql
SELECT passenger_count, COUNT(1) as count, date(lpep_pickup_datetime) as date FROM green_taxi_trips WHERE date(lpep_pickup_datetime)='2019-01-01' and (passenger_count = 2 or passenger_count=3) GROUP BY date, passenger_count
```

```
+-----------------+-------+------------+
| passenger_count | count | date       |
|-----------------+-------+------------|
| 2               | 1282  | 2019-01-01 |
| 3               | 254   | 2019-01-01 |
+-----------------+-------+------------+
SELECT 2
Time: 0.075s
```

## Question 6. Largest tip üèÅ

For the passengers picked up in the Astoria Zone which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip? We want the name of the zone, not the id.

- Long Island City/Queens Plaza

```sql
SELECT puz."Zone" as "pickup_location", doz."Zone" as "dropoff_location", max(tip_amount) as max_tip_amount FROM green_taxi_trips t JOIN taxi_lookup_zones puz on t."PULocationID" = puz."LocationID" JOIN taxi_lookup_zones doz on t."DOLocationID" = doz."LocationID" where puz."Zone" = 'Astoria' group by 1, 2 order by max_tip_amount desc limit 3
```

```
+-----------------+-------------------------------+----------------+
| pickup_location | dropoff_location              | max_tip_amount |
|-----------------+-------------------------------+----------------|
| Astoria         | Long Island City/Queens Plaza | 88.0           |
| Astoria         | Central Park                  | 30.0           |
| Astoria         | Jamaica                       | 25.0           |
+-----------------+-------------------------------+----------------+
SELECT 3
Time: 0.092s
```
